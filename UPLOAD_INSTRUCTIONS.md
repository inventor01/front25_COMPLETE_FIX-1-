# Complete Replit Files - Upload Instructions

## Problem Analysis:
Railway has 129 keywords but 0 tokens processed due to version mismatch between Railway and Replit files.

## Root Cause:
Railway is using outdated files with incompatible parameter signatures:
- DelayedNameExtractor missing 'discord_notifier' parameter
- EnhancedTokenDetector missing 'callback_func' parameter
- Auto-sell monitor coroutine error

## Solution:
Upload ALL these Replit files to Railway to ensure version consistency.

## Upload Process:
1. Download entire COMPLETE_REPLIT_FILES folder
2. Go to https://github.com/inventor01/Front4
3. Upload all files at once
4. Commit: "Update to working Replit codebase - fix token scanning"
5. Wait for Railway deployment

## Expected Result:
- Railway will use same working code as Replit
- Token scanning will become active
- 129 keywords will start processing tokens
- All initialization errors resolved

## Files Included:
All active Python files from Replit plus deployment configs.
This ensures Railway matches the working Replit environment exactly.
