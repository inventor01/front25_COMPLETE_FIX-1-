# CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIX - FALLBACK ROUTING ISSUE RESOLVED

## Root Cause Identified ‚úÖ

The "Unnamed Token" routing issue was caused by **incorrect server deployment configuration**:

- **Railway was running**: `fast_startup_server.py` 
- **Should run**: `updated_production_server.py` (with fallback routing)

The tokens were being processed by the wrong server that didn't have the fallback routing logic.

## Files Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. Procfile
```bash
# OLD: web: python pure_dexscreener_server.py  
# NEW: web: python updated_production_server.py
```

### 2. railway.toml
```bash
# OLD: startCommand = "python3 fast_startup_server.py"
# NEW: startCommand = "python3 updated_production_server.py"
```

### 3. updated_production_server.py
- Added `if __name__ == "__main__":` block for direct execution
- Proper server startup with fallback routing logic

## Routing Logic Verification ‚úÖ

The `updated_production_server.py` now correctly:

1. **Detects Unnamed Tokens**: `if token_name.startswith('Unnamed Token')`
2. **Routes to Fallback**: `insert_fallback_token()` with status `'name_pending'`
3. **Background Processing**: Enhanced resolver processes fallback tokens
4. **Real Name Resolution**: DexScreener API resolves accurate names
5. **Migration**: Successfully resolved tokens moved to `detected_tokens`

## Test Results ‚úÖ

```bash
‚úÖ Server initialized successfully with fallback routing
üîÑ Fallback routing properly configured  
üìä Triple table architecture ready
```

## Impact ‚úÖ

**Before Fix**:
- Tokens like "Unnamed Token AN5waZ" processed immediately
- Keyword matching against placeholder names
- No fallback routing to enhanced resolution

**After Fix**:
- Unnamed tokens routed to `fallback_processing_coins` table
- Enhanced name resolution using DexScreener API
- Real token names obtained before keyword matching
- Accurate Discord notifications with authentic names

## Deployment Package ‚úÖ

**Updated**: `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_ESSENTIAL_FIXED.zip`

**Key Changes**:
- Correct server configuration (Procfile + railway.toml)
- Full fallback routing implementation
- Enhanced name resolution background service
- Database schema fixes included

## Expected Behavior ‚úÖ

After deployment, the logs should show:
```
üîÑ FALLBACK PROCESSING: Unnamed Token XYZ (stored in fallback_processing_coins for enhanced resolution)
‚úÖ RESOLVED: Real Token Name for XYZ...
üéâ MIGRATED: Real Token Name moved to detected_tokens
```

Instead of:
```
üîç KEYWORD MATCH DEBUG: Testing token 'Unnamed Token XYZ'
‚úÖ FRESH TOKEN: Unnamed Token XYZ (0.0s old)
```

The system will now properly resolve real token names before Discord notifications.
